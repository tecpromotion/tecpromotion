### Hi, I'm Stefan ðŸ‘‹

Among other things I am CEO of [@tec-promotion-gmbh](https://github.com/tec-promotion-gmbh/) - a full service digital agency located in fuerth, germany.  
I have been working in the field of web development and web hosting for companies since 1997.  

Around 2002 I came to today's Open Source CMS Joomla! where I have been a member of the board of @jandbeyond since 2009.  
Since 2017 I am the release lead of the German language files [@joomlagerman](https://github.com/joomlagerman/).  
Since 2018 I am the Co-founder and CEO of [@Kicktemp](https://github.com/Kicktemp/) - a digital agency located in hamburg, germany. We are specialised in individual Joomla projects and GDPR solutions such as the Kick Consent Manager or our Joomla plugin for the CMP solution from usercentrics.  
Since Nov. 2020 I am Assistant Team Leader of the Joomla! CMS Release Team and since February 2022 I am the Team Leader aka Translations Coordinator of the Joomla! CMS (Core) Language Team. ([see my volunteers profile](https://volunteers.joomla.org/joomlers/1163-stefan-wendhausen)).

If we do not implement exciting projects with Joomla, we build online shops with the OS ecommerce solution Shopware.  
Feel free to contact or hire me.
